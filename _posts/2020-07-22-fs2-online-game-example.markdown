This post is about implementing a real time online game as an example of what could be implemented
with FS2. This could be of your interest if:

* You want to know more about FS2
* You want to implement a real time online application

This was an interactive presentation that will be eventually transformed
to a post.

Until then [you can see the presentation here](https://algd.github.io/http4s-online-game)
